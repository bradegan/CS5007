# x86-64 Assembly 

> "Nearing Machine Code Representation"

## Introduction/Motivation

Not so long ago (in a galaxy not so far away), programmers wrote most of their code in assembly. While programmers today primarily use higher level languages (Python, C, etc), it is not uncommon to debug the assembly of your code. These higher level languages afterall typically translate down to an assemble or assembly-like language. 

If you are interested in cybersecurity and reverse engineering, folks more frequently write and analyze assembly code. For high performance applications like [games](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/169946/CC_low_level_curriculum_Looking_at_optimized_assembly.php), programmers may write very optimized code using assembly to get things *just* right. If you are working in hardware or an embededd device, you might also do some assembly programming, as other languages environments are too bulky to support on a small device. Even web developers are using something called 'webassembly'. Hmm, the list is getting long here--I think the point is that learning assembly has quite some relevance! Let's dig in and get some practice.

In today's lab you are going to get some practice looking at assembly.

# Part 0 - Godbolt

I **strongly** recommend using the godbolt tool (https://godbolt.org/) to write and experiment with your C programs for this exercise.  The color mappings will help you see what is going on with the generated assembly. You **should** try using both godbolt and your compiler to generate assembly.

Here is an example of the Godbolt tool (and also shows part 4 of this lab)

# Part 1- Compiler Generated Assembly

Let us get some experience reading assembly code generated by the compiler (or godbolt)! It is actually kind of fun, you may learn some new instructions, and at the very least gain some intuition for what code the compiler is generating.

## Compiler generated assembly 1 - Swap

- Write a C program that swaps two integers(in the main body of code).
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as swap_int.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin swap_int.c -S -o swap_int.s`
- Now modify your program to swap two long's.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as swap_long.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin swap_long.c -S -o swap_long.s`
- Compare each of the two assembly files using diff. See what changed.
- diff syntax
  - Use: `diff -y swap_int.s swap_long.s`
  
### Response/Observations

When storing literals in stack: in swap_int.s, 4 bytes are used; whereas in swap_long.s, 8 bytes are used.
When storing data for variable temp: in swap_int.s, eax is used, whereas in swap_long.s, rax is used.
In swap_int.s, movl is called, whereas in swap_long, movq is called.


## Compiler generated assembly 2 - Functions

- Write a C program that swaps two integers in a **function** (You may use today's slide as a reference)
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as swap.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  swap.c -S -o swap.s`
- Do the instructions use memory/registers in a different way?

### Response/Observations

Both rax and eax is used.

## Compiler generated assembly 3 - Static Array
- Write a C program called array.c that has an array of 400 integers in the function of main.
  - Initialize some of the values to something (do not use a loop) (e.g. myArray[0]=72; myArray[70]=56; etc)
  	- Note that it is helpful to use 'weird' numbers so you can see where they jump out.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as array.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  array.c -S -o array.s`
- How much are the offsets from the address?

### Response/Observations

The main function initializes with: subq    $1480, %rsp

Each int is stored in 4 bytes in the stack. So myArray[0] is stored at -1600.

## Compiler generated assembly 4 - Dynamic Array 

- Write a C program called array2.c that has an array of 400 integers in the function of main that is dynamically allocated.
  - Initialize some of the values to something (do not use a loop) (e.g. myArray[66]=712; myArray[70]=536; etc)
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as array2.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  array2.c -S -o array2.s`
- Study the assembly and think about what is different from the static array.

### Response/Observations

In dynamic allocated array, the element in array is accessed by a pointer, and the pointer is moved to the next element
to access by %addq operation on %rax.

In static array, the element is accessed by specified position, and the program goes directly to certain position in the stack.

## Compiler generated assembly 5 - Goto
The C programming language has a 'goto' command, search how to use it if you have not previously.

- Write a C program using the goto command and a label.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as goto.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  goto.c -S -o goto.s`
- Observe what kind of jmp statement is inserted.

### Response/Observations

'nop' is called at goto.

## Compiler generated assembly 6 - For-loops
- Write a C program using a for-loop that counts to 5.
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as for.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin  for.c -S -o for.s`
- Observe where the code goes for the condition statement (at the start or at the end?).

### Response/Observations


The programs initializes the iterator in for statement first, then jump to the comparison statement; if the comparison passes, then jump
to the body of the for-loop.

## Compiler generated assembly 7 - Switch Statements

- Write a C program using a switch statement (Sample here)[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/switch_statement_in_c.htm].
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as switch.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin switch.c -S -o switch.s`
- See what code a switch statement generates. Is it optimal?

### Response/Observations

The first case is tested, if the test passes, the program goes to the first branch; if not, the second case is tested.
It is the same as if-else if-else statements, so it is optimal.

## Compiler generated assembly 8 - Add Function

- Write a C program that calls an add function(long add(long a, long b).
  - Save, Compile, and Run the program to verify it works.
- Output the assembly from that program (Save it as add.s).
  - Use: `gcc -O0 -fno-builtin add.c -S -o add.s`
- Observe the outputs
- Observe arguments put into registers
- Observe where 'popq' is called.

### Response/Observations

popq is called at the end of the function, after rdx and rax is added.

# Deliverable

- For part 1, add your .S files that you have generated to this repository.
  - Note this submission will be auto graded for completion (i.e. save the file names as shown).
  - Add your observations in the appropriate response/observations section for each code.

# Going Further

- (Optional) Try the objdump example to read the disassembly from your programs executables. Observe how close the output is to the compiler generated output.
